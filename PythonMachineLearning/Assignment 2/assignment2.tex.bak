\section{Overall marking scheme}

The coursework for COMP222 consists of two assignments 
contributing altogether 20\% of the final mark. The contribution of the single
assignments is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lr}
Assignment 1 & 10\% \\
Assignment 2 & 10\% \\
\hline 
TOTAL        & 20\%

\section{No Error Policy}
\framebox[\textwidth]{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{\textbf{I enforce a ``no error policy'' in 
this module: If your code does not 
compile, your mark will be capped at 40\%. Thus, you may get a higher mark
for an incomplete solution than for an advanced sketch.}}}

\medskip 

If you want to show me your attempt to add some features that does not compile 
TOGETHER with your working code, feel free to submit TWO jar files
clearly indicating which one of them contains working code and which contains
an incomplete one. In this case, you will not be penalised and you can 
get a higher mark. 

\section{Robocode}
Robocode  is a programming game, where
the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks. The
robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.  Robots can move, shoot
at each other, scan for each other, and hit the walls (or other robots).
More details can be found on the project web site, \url{http://robocode.sourceforge.net/}

\section{Objectives}

This assignment requires you to design and implement a tank bot for the
Robocode tank battle game. You need to choose a game AI behaviour model (such
as, for example, finite state machine, decision trees, behaviour trees, or any
other mechanism of your choice) and implement your robot based on this
behaviour model. 


\section{Marking scheme}
You are required to submit Java code and an electronic document describing your design and
implementation.
\subsection{Documentation (40\% of the mark)}
You are required to submit a 700 to 1\,000 words document containing:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item
A short description of the behaviour control model of your choice (e.g., FSM,
Decision trees, etc.). You only need to write a couple of paragraphs to show
your understanding of how the model works.
\mbox{}\hfill\textbf{10~marks}
%%%
\item A Robocode bot design description. In your design you should use the
chosen behaviour control mechanism. For example, if you choose FSMs to
represent bot's behaviour, give a graphical representation of states,
transitions, and conditions under which the machine switches from one state to another.
If you choose a tree-based model, give a graphical representation 
of the tree and clearly indicate tests and actions. Justify your design 
decisions, in particular, comment on why you believe
these design decisions makes your bot more likely win the tournament.
\mbox{}~\hfill\textbf{20~marks}
%%%
\item 
A description of you implementation. Explain what classes and methods are used
to implement the chosen behaviour model. You are not restricted  in HOW you
implement the bot (you can hard-code the behaviour in an ad-hoc manner,
implement a general scheme, or use a third-party library) but your mark will
depend on how closely you follow the design. You are allowed to deviated from
the design; however, if your implementation does differ from the design, 
clearly identify and justify the modifications.
\mbox{}~\hfill\textbf{10~marks}

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Implementation (30\% of the mark)}
When you create a new robot in the editor use the following naming convention
\begin{description}
\item[Robot name:] 
Please try to give your robot a unique name. That could be
\textsf{FirstnameSecondname}
(for example, I would use \textsf{BorisKonev}) without spaces and  special characters,
letter 'A' followed by your student ID as in \textsf{A200812345}
(this can compromize your ID),
or any other name that is unlikely to be chosen by others, e.g.,
\textsf{Crusher15041991}.

Please put your full name and student ID as a comment in the beginning of
every Java file that you submit. 

\item[Package name:] use \textsf{comp222}\\
\textbf{If you use a different package name, your bot might be lost and not make it
to the competition.}
\end{description}

The implementation will be marked as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Providing response to battle events (onScannedRobot, onHitByBullet, onHitWall,\dots)
\mbox{}\hfill\textbf{10~marks}
\item Following the design
\mbox{}\hfill\textbf{10~marks}
\item Clarity and style of code
\mbox{}\hfill\textbf{10~marks}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Battle competition(30\% of the mark)}
Submitted bots will take part in a tournament. In order to qualify to
participate in the tournament, you should make a reasonable effort to modify the
default (bot skeleton in the editor) behaviour. Additionally, \textbf{no robot with code taken 
from elsewhere (with or without acknowledging the source) will be allowed in the competition}.

In the tournament bots will be randomly divided in groups of about 10 bots each
(depending on the number of submission); group winners will progress to battle
in the next round.

The battlefield size is Robocode default.

In the end, bots will be ranked by the \textbf{Robocode Total Score}. Those in the upper
third of the ranking will get extra 30\%, those in the middle third will get
extra 20\%, and those in the lower third will get extra 10\%.


{If for some reason you do not wish your robot to take part in the tournament,
please let me know in advance.}

\section{Deadlines and How to Submit}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deadline for submitting the second assignment is Monday, 29 April at
3pm.

\item Submission is via the departmental submission system accessible
(from withing the department) from \\
\url{http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/teaching/modules/year2s2/comp222.html}.\\

\item In order to submit your bot, export it as a Jar file by choosing\\
\mbox{Robot$\to$``Package robot for upload''} in the Robocode menu.
